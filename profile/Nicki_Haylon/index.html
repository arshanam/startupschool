			<p ccID="961">You can call me Nicki. I am a recent graduate of Roger Williams University in Bristol, RI where I studied Creative Writing, Graphic Design, and Spanish. I am excessively creative and am looking to apply that creativity to a marketing position in a startup, as well as learn the more analytical side of marketing here at Boston Startup School! Besides that, I am a borderline perfectionist: very results-driven and I never leave a project unfinished. I come from a baseball-loving family and I am a huge Red Sox fan. I love to travel, be outside, and watch pretty much every movie that appears on Netflix. 
<p>
I am very hard-working and goal-oriented. I have high expectations for myself that I strive to meet everyday. I love to laugh and make those around me happy. I'm a positive person who has had a great 21 years of life thus far and is looking forward to the future.
