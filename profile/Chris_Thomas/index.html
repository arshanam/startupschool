          <h2>Background:</h2>
          <p>Dean was introduced to the startup world through co-founding Shopkick; a YC company with some friends of his from college in 2006, one year before graduating. After earning his degree from Olin College one month after it was accredited, Dean spent two years at a defense contractor working on intelligent networked munitions, followed by a three-year stint as a full-time program director and instructor (and IT person, sales person, social media person) at a local Karate school. After being laid off in March from his teaching job, he went to Baja, Mexico to earn his 200-hour Yoga Teaching Certification. He is very excited to be returning to the fast-paced startup world!</p>
