          <h2>Background:</h2>
          <p>	I started my career search wanting to work in investment banking and after some experience in the field quickly realized that I was wrong. Whether it be the backwards view of innovation or the extreme need for a culture overhaul I knew it was not for me. However, negative my experience it helped me polish an analytical view of a lot of things (as well as spending a good amount of time in Powerpoint and excel).
<br>
<br>
Leading me to find refuge in the world of startups, first Coursekit[now lore] where I did brand marketing and was part of the campus founders program, then a local molecular diagnostics start up and finally Boundless. At Boundless, I helped prepare for their launch as well design and implement email campaigns. 
<br>
<br>
My experience at each ranged from sales to web design[as I have some front end and design experience] all the while enjoying the thrill that ensued. I helped Lore launch helped Ischemia care brand/reposition and Boundless launch for the fall. Additionally, while in Boston I was able to take part in Boston Startup School. I can't get enough!
