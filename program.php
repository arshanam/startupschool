							Interdisciplinary work, where each team includes someone from every track, develops communication skills and allows students to build something substantial. The Sales & Business Development and Marketing tracks also team up to think analytically about the connection between marketing a product and building an effective sales force while the Product & Design and Software Development tracks work together to ideate and prototype products. During 'Idea Jams' and the culminating 'Capstone Project' teams work to solve Design Partners' real-world challenges, something that individuals can point to as evidence of their newfound skills and experience.
