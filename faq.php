					<div class="sectionsubtitle">What is Boston Startup School (BSS)?</div>
					Boston Startup School is a professional accelerator for recent college graduates, career changers, and entrepreneurs who are seeking entry into the startup world. Born from TechStars, our program helps these awesome individuals develop skills, grow their networks, and find a career they are passionate about. Unlike internships and other educational programs, Boston Startup School offers insights and training from hand-selected industry leaders and interdisciplinary projects that combine to accelerate your growth as a superstar.
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">How much does it cost?</div>
					Boston Startup School is free to students because our partners pay for your tuition. This does not mean you are obligated to work for one of our partners after the program, but we urge you to strongly consider roles within these companies. We handpicked them all so they have to be great, right?
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">When is the program?</div>
					Boston Startup School runs full-time programs quarterly. For those who cannot commit to such a time intensive program, we are also developing part-time night and weekend options to better work with your current schedule. 
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">Where is Boston Startup School?</div>
					We partnered with Harvard and hosted the first class at the Harvard Innovation Lab. We are currently exploring our options for a future location and will publicize this information once we have confirmed our new location. We promise, it will be awesome.
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">How long is the program?</div>
					6 weeks. Project work and additional exposure to companies that are hiring can extend beyond the official program, but we encourage our alumni to be engaged and stick around as long as they'd like. We miss you when you go. 
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">Why should I choose to attend BSS?</div>
					If you are looking to learn valuable, relevant skills in order to be an effective employee at a startup AND grow your network within the Boston startup community, then BSS is a great place to launch your career. Whether you want to join a startup, grow your own business, or take your skills to the next level, the program is designed to help individuals at every phase in the post-grad experience.
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">Who is behind the program?</div>
					Well, there's a number of incredible people. Boston Startup School is supported by a passionate <a href="who.php">staff</a>, as well as key members of the community whose focus is to advance the career of every individual who attends. In addition to that, there are well over 50 instructors who play a huge role in the program's success and <a href="press.php">dozens of companies</a> from the community who support the mission of Boston Startup School and are looking to hire students upon completion of the program.  
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">What is the application process?</div>
					It's easy. First, submit your online application. If we like what we see, the next step is a Skype interview. After that, we will ask you to do a short project or task to showcase your skills and commitment. Then, if you're a superstar, we will invite you to a final interview. Boom - you're in.
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">What do you look for in a candidate?</div>
					Intelligence. Both intellectual and emotional. Communication skills and coachability. We look for bright, ambitious, action-oriented risk takers that are eager to work in the fast-paced world of startups. 
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">Do I have to be a US citizen?</div>
					No, but we do not sponsor or handle any visa related issues.
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">What is the level of commitment?</div>
					We expect that you be present and ready to learn Monday through Friday from about 9am to 6pm for the entire duration of the program. There are also various social and networking events on nights and weekends we highly recommend attending. 
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">What is the typical schedule like at BSS?</div>
					The great thing is that each day is different at BSS. Like a startup, the schedule is in flux because we are constantly working to pull in great people to come and connect with our students. There will be some morning networking, specialty track time, guest lecturers, skill shares, group project work, crosstrack shenanigans, and of course, time for social activities that deliver a needed dose of stress relief. Students are encouraged to attend events together after class.
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">Who are the instructors?</div>
					CEOs, CTOs, VPs, and key leaders from within the community you're about to enter. They're all hand selected and trained by our Educators-in-Residence who helps fine tune lessons every day based on student-driven feedback and suggestions. 
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">Can I work and be part of the full-time program?</div>
					While students in the past have attended BSS and held internships at the same time, we do not recommend committing to any internship or full-time work experience for more than 10 hours per week. Boston Startup School is a full-time, immersive experience and we expect the program to be your number one priority.
					
					<div class="sectionsubtitle">What opportunities are there in the startup community? </div>
					In May 2012, there were more than 3,000 open positions in technology companies, in Boston alone. We can't fill all of those positions, but we do expect our graduates to be awesomely employed because of their passionate drive, great personalities, and newly minted skills.
