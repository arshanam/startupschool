						<div class="span8">
							<p>It all started at TechStars in Boston. Each Session, the team would continuously ask around the ecosystem "how can we be more helpful?" and they found the answer wasn't always about financing, but instead about people. Human capital. People who were hungry for a startup and didn't require training; yet could operate without heavy guidance, make high-impact decisions and deliver immediate value. The team at TechStars began thinking how they could equip the best and brightest minds with in-demand skills they needed to make immediate impact in startups. With an idea, guts and tons of support, Katie Rae got on stage at Ruby Riot and told the community what was about to hit them - the Boston Startup School was launching. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Since that point, they've built a team who has been hard at work building an experience complete with action-based curriculum and relevant startup practitioners as instructors. The applicant response for the inaugural class was astonishing, rivaling that of an Ivy League institution. You can apply for future sessions of the program <a href="apply.php">here</a>.
